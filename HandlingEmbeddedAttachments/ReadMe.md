**Handling Embedded Attachments in your mail using VBA**

If you receive an attachment which itself is an email how do you access that attachment and what if it has attachments itself! how do you access those files.
It is possible and you don't need to create a new Class for it. The Application class is all you need.
In the following code file there is the VBA for this solution. You can open it in notepad or similar to retrieve the functions and routines. You can, then, paste it into your ThisOutlookSession.cls code Class Module in your Outlook. 

The example script is here: https://github.com/MrAnalyticals/OutlookVBA/blob/main/HandlingEmbeddedAttachments/ThisOutlookSession.txt
