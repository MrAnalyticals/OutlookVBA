Handling Embedded Attachments in your mail
If you receive an attachment which itself is an email how do you access that attachment and what if it has attachments itself! how do you access those files.
It is possible and you don't need to create a new Class for it. The Application class is all you need.

The example script is here: https://github.com/MrAnalyticals/OutlookVBA/blob/main/HandlingEmbeddedAttachments/ThisOutlookSession.cls
